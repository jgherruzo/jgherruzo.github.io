            <p><b>Shift Manager (General shutdown 2022 | General shutdown 2019): </b>Catalyst replacement activities (30 workers)</p>
            <p><b>Minor elements Management (2021-*): </b>Responsible of bottleneck analysis 
              in order to increase element "A" removal without affecting the facility 
              integrity. Follow-up of important minor elements behavior. Responsible for 
              analyzing the behavior of minor element "B" in the process, detecting the 
              influence variables and making 
              easier the planning of the feed mixture. Increase the minor element 
              treatment in the copper raw material without affecting the plant integrity or the product and subproduct quality gives an important business 
              edge.</p>
              <p><b>Energy Management System (2020-*): </b>Energy Team Responsible in 
                Sulphuric Acid Plant and Effluent Treatment plant. Refrigeration water requirement reduction. Steam production increased. Projects proposed to potential recovering about 200 GWh/year
                </p>
              <p><b>Machine Learning models (2020-*): </b>Catalyst pressure drop behavior prediction model, saving more than 20 days of production.
                 Gas management optimization model which help team to minimize electrical consumption and maximize steam production.
                  Gas Cleaning plant capacity follow-up which let the operator knows their gas management capacity.
                   SO2 emission follow-up which help the team to detect changes in the process as soon as they happened. 
                  Catalyst activity follow-up which help to understand the performance of the catalyst without manual analysis.</p>
              <p><b>Focus Group (2019-2021): </b>Project focused on increasing the proactivity of 
                the workers regarding safety issues. Consists of a multidisciplinary 
                team that meet themselves periodically to analyze the most important 
                risks in each area, developing solutions for each one and sharing them 
                with the rest of the organization.
                </p>
              <p><b>Emission Reduction Plan (2018-2022): </b>Strategic project to decrease 
                emissions level in the whole facility. Developing a new catalyst 
                distribution for Sulphuric Acid Plant (SAP) 2 (Emission level potencial 
                reduction of 20%). Pipe modification in SAP3 and SAP 1 to avoid gases 
                leakage (Emission level was reduced in 15% per plant). Developing 
                weekly follow up with operation and maintenance departments for 
                faster troubleshooting.</p>
              <p><b>Gas Management (2019-*): </b>Atmospheric air intake is an important source 
                of emission increase and production losses. Detecting the point of the 
                air inlet allow maintenance team to be focused on the correct 
                location. Developing a real time model for detecting points of air inlets 
                makes faster maintenance answer. In the other hand, avoiding air intakes saves energy consumption.</p>
              <p><b>Acid Quality (2017): </b>Acid quality depends on the level of certain minor element. The knowledge about the 
                characterization of one of this minor element is very important to select the correct 
                technology for remove it. Some tests were developed to demonstrate 
                that the current characterization of this elemnt in this plant is different than the 
                standard and the selected technology was not the best one, saving 
                about 2MM€.</p>
